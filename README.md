# galdeep

Welcome here!

Still in development phase, `galdeep` is a small python package that aims to use the power of neural networks to improve modelling of complex galaxy shapes, with a strong amphasis on galaxies deformed by gravitational lensing. The basic idea is to learn some prior knowledge about noise properties of deformed galaxies, allowing an easier reconstruction in pixel space.
